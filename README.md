# competition_nlp Project

## Overview

The **competition_nlp** project addresses limitations in current large language models (LLMs) by focusing on domain-specific language corpora. This initiative aims to contribute to enhanced language models by creating an accessible dataset focused on decisions issued by competition agencies and judges from different jurisdictions.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to collect and curate a specialized dataset revolving around decisions related to competition law. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI).

## Dataset Description

The dataset will consist of diverse decisions issued by competition agencies and judges. Covering a variety of cases, it provides a comprehensive sample of the language used in legal contexts related to competition law. The project aims to support researchers in developing and fine-tuning language models specifically tailored to the nuances of competition law.
